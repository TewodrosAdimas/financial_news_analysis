## Task 1: Git and GitHub

**Tasks:**
- Setting up the Python environment
- Git version control
- CI/CD

**Overview:**
- Create a GitHub repository and initialize the project.
- Create branches for each task and commit changes regularly.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on news and stock data, including descriptive statistics, text analysis, time series analysis, and publisher analysis.

## Task 2: Quantitative Analysis Using PyNance and TA-Lib

**Tasks:**
- Load and prepare stock price data.
- Apply technical analysis indicators using TA-Lib.
- Use PyNance for financial metrics.
- Visualize the data to understand the impact of different indicators on stock prices.

**Overview:**
- Merge branches from Task 1 into the main branch.
- Create a new branch for Task 2 and commit changes.
- Calculate and visualize basic technical indicators.

## Task 3: Correlation Between News and Stock Movement

**Tasks:**
- Ensure datasets (news and stock prices) are aligned by dates.
- Conduct sentiment analysis on news headlines using libraries like NLTK and TextBlob.
- Calculate daily stock returns and analyze correlation between news sentiment and stock returns.

**Overview:**
- Merge branches from Task 2 into the main branch.
- Create a new branch for Task 3 and commit changes.
- Normalize dates, perform sentiment analysis, compute daily returns, and analyze correlation.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Navigate to the `notebooks` directory to run Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis.
- Use scripts in the `scripts` directory to run analyses and calculations.
- Tests can be found in the `tests` directory and are run using standard testing frameworks.
