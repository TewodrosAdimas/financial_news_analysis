News Dataset Analysis Projects
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing a news dataset, focusing on different aspects of the data, including descriptive statistics, publisher analysis, text analysis, and time series analysis.

Notebooks
1. Descriptive Statistics Analysis (descriptive_statistics.ipynb)
This notebook performs a basic analysis of the news dataset, including:

Read Data: Loads the dataset and prints the first few lines.
Textual Length Statistics: Obtains basic statistics for headline lengths.
Publisher Count: Counts the number of articles per publisher and views the results as a DataFrame.
Publication Date Analysis: Analyzes publication dates to observe trends over time.
2. Publisher Analysis (publisher_analysise.ipynb)
This notebook provides a detailed analysis of publishers, including:

Publisher Contribution: Observes each publisher’s contribution to the dataset.
News Classification: Classifies news types based on predefined keywords.
Top 20 Publishers: Identifies the top 20 publishers and examines the effect of news categories on their publications.
Visualization: Visualizes the number of publications by category and publisher.
3. Text Analysis (text_analysise.ipynb)
This notebook focuses on the semantic analysis of headlines, including:

Semantic Analysis: Uses NLTK to perform sentiment analysis on headlines.
Common Words Identification: Identifies and analyzes common words in headlines.
4. Time Series Analysis (time_series_analysise.ipynb)
This notebook examines the effect of time on the number of publications, including:

Time Series Visualization: Visualizes the time series data of publication counts.
Publication Timing Analysis: Identifies specific times when the most news is released.
